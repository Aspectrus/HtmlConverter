<p>Assessing an enterprise’s deployment requirements begins with understanding its hardware and infrastructure environment, and determining whether that hardware can support Windows 10, and the features of Windows 10 deemed important for the enterprise. Moving to Windows 10 in most cases will be very straight forward and require minimal updates to an enterprises’ existing deployment process, though they will now have more options. The recommended strategy is to deploy Windows 10 as the base platform, then through Windows as a service, new features will be delivered. Moving to Windows 10 as mentioned earlier, will not be as expensive or time consuming as an upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7. In most cases, hardware and software will be compatible with Windows 10.  In this module we will look at the capabilities of  management and deployment tools to address this evolution.</p>
